# About me
Second-year CS student @ Rochester Institute of Technology.

Proud Rustacean and c# denier.

House music enthusiast and rugby player.


## What am I working on?
I am learning design patterns for creating backend services. In particular, I like working with actix-web and rust.

Additionally, I am working with frontend projects in Angular and Next.js.

Outside of school, I am learning about digital audio processing using platform APIs and open source libraries, such as CoreAudio, ASIO and PortAudio. Eventually, I would like to experiment with real time audio processing using Rust to develop VST and AudioUnit plugins.

## Why Rust?
I was raised on Java and OOP. After learning C for a class, I began to enjoy imperative programming. One thing I hated was constant crashes and segmentation faults.

Rust doesn't come naturally. However, it teaches (forces) one to write better, safer code. When invalid states are unrepresentable, it is far easier to write robust code. After spending a few months writing purely Rust, even my OOP code has improved.
